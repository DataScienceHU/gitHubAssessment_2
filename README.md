# 52414 GitHub Practice - Assessment 2  

Assessment 2 in moodle  

  

## GitHub Walk-Through:    

Instructions:  

1. If you have followed the steps using the GitHub-Classroom [Invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/c6YKc9qd), you should have created your assessment 2 repository. Please clone the repository to your local computer using the `git clone` command.   
2. In your local assignment repository, please create a new branch called `firstName_branch`. Checkout to this branch using `git checkout`, and finally push changes using `git push`.    
3. In your new branch, please create a simple (non Rmd) R file named `assessment_2_FamName_Name.R`, that prints `Hello World` when executed. 
4. Add the file to git using `git add`.  
5. Commit your changes with a comment that contains the date of your commit, together with your full name (using `git commit -m "message"`).   
6. Push your changes to your branch using `git push`, then merge your branch to master using `git merge`.   
7. For good measure, make sure your repository is up-to-date and everything was synced and merged. 
    
**It helps to use `git status` during the various steps to verify the status of the repository.**     
  
      
        
### Good Luck!
