Assessment 2 in moodle  

Instructions:  

* If you have followed the steps using the GitHub-Classroom, you should have created your assessment 2 repository. Please clone the repository to your local computer using `git clone` command.   
* In your local assignment repository, please create a new branch called `firstName_branch`. Checkout to this branch using `git checkout`, and finally push changes using `git push`.    
* In your new branch, please create a simple (non Rmd) R file named `assessment_2_FamName_Name.R`, that prints `Hello World` when executed. 
* Add the file to git using `git add`.  
* Commit your changes with a comment that contains the date of your commit, together with your full name.   
* Push your changes to your branch using `git push`, then merge your branch to master using `git merge`.   
    
**It helps to use `git status` during the various steps to verify the status of the repository. **
